Much of the work spans the globe, with transactions involving our offices in London, Brussels, Hong<br/>Kong and Beijing as well as leading independent law firms in many other jurisdictions. <br/><br/>The matters we work on are generally challenging and sophisticated. We do, however, aim to give associates as much responsibility and client contact as they are ready for. Junior associates may take the lead either on the matter as a whole or a part of it.  We recognise that individuals all need to develop at their own pace so your progress and workload will be continually monitored and reviewed with your mentor partner.<br/><br/>The Competition Team<br/>We have a reputation as one of the world's leading 'go to' competition law practices and our associates have regular involvement in cutting edge work.

We encourage associates to maintain a broader caseload (across both contentious and non-contentious matters) and not overspecialise. As a general guide we would expect  about 50% of the workload to be merger work with the remaining 50% being a mixture of cartel, abuse of dominance, state aid, public procurement, regulatory and other contentious matters. We find this leads to greater involvement in clients' broader business  interests.<br/>As an associate with us, you can expect to be working with a number of partners in the group at any one time, giving you the opportunity to build relationships across the broader team. Depending on the scale and complexity of the project, you may operate as  the single associate on a matter or work as part of a larger team. You will also have the opportunity to develop contacts across the firm: for example, our competition associates regularly work alongside corporate, dispute resolution and intellectual property  lawyers, providing clients with integrated legal advice.<br/><br/>Key Responsibilities<br/>- Advising on a range of competition law and commercial issues<br/>- Drafting, reviewing and amending the legal and commercial aspects of documentation<br/>- Developing professional relationships with clients<br/>- Supporting the wider team in developing business and raising the profile of the firm<br/>- Managing/supervising the work of others including trainees<br/><br/>Key skills and attributes<br/>- Ability to draft, advise and negotiate in relation to complex transactions<br/>- First rate legal/commercial knowledge<br/>- Strong academic background (the equivalent of high 2.1 degree and AAB at A-level) and a demonstrable high level of intellectual analysis<br/>- Excellent client relationship skills<br/>- Excellent efficiency and transaction management skills<br/>- Ability to develop and work in a fast paced, intellectually challenging environment<br/>- Resilient under pressure with the ability to manage multiple deadlines<br/>- High level of professionalism and integrity<br/>- Exposure across a range of high value commercial and corporate transactions or similar (e.g. advising companies in regulated sectors such as telecoms, energy, broadcasting etc.)<br/><br/>Location: City of London <br/>Salary: £92,000 - £150,000<br/>Closing Date: 18/05/2020</span>"

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com</p> <p>Overview of the independent end-point assessor role</p> <p>Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with.</p> <p>An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices.</p> <p>The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality  assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives.</p> <p>IEAs will meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided  by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details.</p> <p><strong>Key Accountabilities:</strong></p> <p>The IEA will:</p> <p>· Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of IEA for this EPA</p> <p>· Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD)</p> <p>· Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained</p> <p>· Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs</p> <p>· Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes</p> <p>· Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration</p> <p>· Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately</p> <p>· Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions</p> <p>· Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements</p> <p>· Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment</p> <p>· Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson</p> <p>· Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities</p> <p>· Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by Ofqual.</p> <p><strong>Person Specification</strong></p> <p><strong>Occupational Profile:</strong></p> <p>Senior Healthcare Support Workers (SHCSW) help registered practitioners deliver healthcare services to people.

SHCSWs follow the Code of Conduct for Healthcare Support Workers and Adult Social Care Workers.</p> <p><strong>Maternity Support</strong></p> <p>Maternity Support Workers assist midwives to look after pregnant women, mothers and newborn babies in a range of settings.
